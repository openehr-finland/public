## Introduction

This implementation guide describes the languages ​​used in the modeling work and how the translation and localization of data models to the Finnish language is implemented.

### Background

- Translation is the process of rendering text from one language into another so that the meaning is equivalent. 
- Localization is a more comprehensive process and addresses cultural and non-textual components as well as linguistic issues when adapting a product or service for another country or locale.

The definition of translation in general, is very simplistic. A text can be transfered from one language to the next in various ways. And there is not ”one correct way” to do it, it all depend on the purpose.
You need to decide what is more important, staying closer to the source language or closer to the target language. You cannot do both.
openEHR archetypes cannot be separated from context, since they describe context. An archetype describes a clinical situation, which is very much in the real world. 
The challenge is to preserve the source language meaning of an archetype when transfering it to a whole new culture where society is built upon.

## Implementation overview

Agreed practice in Finland on openEHR modeling and writing guidences.

The goal of the openEHR translation work in Finland is to translate the archetypes so that they are localized to the Finnish operating environment, using international archetypes as widely as possible. In practice, this means that national legislation, recommendations, vocabularies and code lists must be taken into account in the implementation of the translation work. In addition, we always try to use well-established expressions used in clinical work.

The translation work primarily aims to ensure compatibility with the Finnish operating environment by developing expressions of the original archetype or expanding the archetypes, if necessary.

### Standard process for translation work

When openEHR Finland receives openEHR affiliate status at the beginning of 2025, a Jira board will be established to manage the archetype translation work. Board is used to track which archetypes have been identified as requiring translation, which translation work is in progress, and which are progressing to commenting and approval. More detailed instructions will be produced later.

**Translation and internal review**
| Task | Actor | Additional information |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Identify and investigate the local need for translation. | Local actor |  |
| Check if there is a translation in CKM, openerEHR Finland Github repository or by asking openEHR Finland. | Local actor | User rights to CKM and GitHub are needed! |
| Translate the archetype, or the archetypes from scratch or continue on the previous translation (if available). Follow guidelines described on this page. | Local actor | |
| Review the translation in local group. | Local actor | |
| Review the translation in local group. | Local actor | |
| Contact openEHR Finland to announce that there is a translation ready for formal review. | Local actor | Commit the archetype openEHR Finland's GitHub [draft repository](https://github.com/openehr-finland/openehr-finland) and contact openEHR Finland. |
| Make decisions on the translation quality is sufficient for a formal review | OpenEHR Finland | Check out the translation and commit it to CKM. |

**Formal review**
| Task | Actor | Additional information |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Find suitable (which competencies should be included) reviewers based on the archive content | Local actor in consultation with openEHR Finland | not only from local actors |
| Start formal review in the CKM tool with mailing to all Finnish CKM members | openEHR Finland | The role of translation editor required in CKM
| If necessary, book a review meeting with text mailings for those without CKM membership. | openEHR Finland | Although there are many divided opinions expected to exist.
| Update the translation based on comments during the review meeting. If no review meeting is held, this is done at a separate adjustment meeting. | Local actor or other designated actor | Adjustment meeting may be in connection with review meeting |
| Make decisions if further review is needed or check in and mark translation as approved in CKM | openEHR Finland | The role of translation editor required in CKM |

**Publish to HL7 Finland standards**
	
Informs HL7 Finland's technical committee about the completed translations. If necessary, the commenting and approval process according to the association's rules will be started.

### Detailed descriptions

Technical implementation instructions for the translation work
- [Translate Archetypes using CKM](https://openehr.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/healthmod/pages/2949125/Translate+Archetypes+Using+CKM) (in Finland option 2 is prefered and we use Archetype Designer)

#### Archetype development

The aim is always to use existing international archetypes as a basis for the modeling work. The archetypes are translated into Finnish as the modeling work progresses, utilizing the described translation process.
All new archetypes are authored in English first and then translated into Finnish according to international practices.

Always try to use well-established and defined Finnish terms in translations, which can be found in e.g. of the following services:
- [National code server](https://koodistopalvelu.kanta.fi/codeserver/)
- [National vocabulary service](https://sotesanastot.thl.fi/vocabularies)
- Snomed CT and ICD10/11 translations

It should be noted that according to the recommendations of the international openEHR community, translation work should refrain from changing the original meaning and descriptions of the archetypes. However, somethimes the examples and recommendations in the original English descriptions of the archetypes can either be changed to reflect the Finnish operating environment or left out completely. If in the descriptions or other definitions of the original archetype, too specific levels are identified, which cause problems in the national localization work, these observations can be reported to the international community in the form of proposals for changes.

#### Templates

The openEHR templates are created in Finnish. The recommendation is that the archetypes needed for a template are localized and translated into Finnish in advance. The template is constructed after the translation process is completed.

#### Writing rules

**Abbreviations**
Do not use English abbreviations, unless they are very well rooted in the Finnish medical vocabulary (formally, not in speech).

**Simple and straight formulations**
Write briefly and clearly; avoid multi-ordid and complicated formulations.
Do not be afraid to devie from the original if the formulation becomes clumsy in Finnish.
Example: Write “The respiratory rate is...” instead of “The remortmity of the respiratory rate is...”

**Definite or indefinite form**
Follow the national guidelines as far as possible, but take into account the current context, don’t switch within a single archetype.

**Slashes**
Avoid typing "/" in body text, print with words instead.
Example: Write "less than or equal" instead of "less than/equal"

Avoid writing "and/or." Instead, write “or”. In Finnish, the disjunction is "or" including, i.e. the expression "x or y" means that both x and y can apply or only one of them. To express exclusively or, i.e. that only one or the other may apply, use the wording "either" using "either x or y".

**Decimal signs**
Use comma as decimal point.
Example Write "39,6 degrees", not "39.6 degrees."

**Semicolon**
Use the semicolon, but be careful. English uses semicolon in a slightly different way and often a little more generous than Finnish does.

**Units**
Follow the SNOMED Guidelines.

**The term individual/person/patient**
The situation determines which translation is most appropriate. Be consistent within a single archetype translation. Follow guidelines on national [vocabularies](https://sotesanastot.thl.fi/termed-publish-server/vocabulary/5deffdd9-14bf-4e5c-b1d7-b001cd52619e/concept/8a68003e-97eb-47ae-b314-f9e47ae7f9c3).
